✅ Tested this module and verified it works as expected

### Changes if I re-fabricate this again

- [DONE] Label the Vin capacitor as 330µf
- Make a little more space for the heatseat (still fits as is)
- Make a little more space for the Vin 330µf cap (still fits as is)
- Perhaps add a "disable LED" switch in case you are looking to save on a little current usage
