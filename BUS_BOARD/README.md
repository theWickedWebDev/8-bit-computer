# BUS Board

MORE DETAILS TO COME

Made a board to help me while testing the modular components. It pulls the lines LOW as well as has 8 LED status indicator lights.

## QA
âœ… Tested this module and verified it works as expected

### Changes if I re-fabricate this again

- Perhaps I would want to include all the `74LS245` chips from other modules onto this board instead.
- Resize this board so that (perhaps) I could place this underneath all the other modules and be able to plug them into this board directly - instead of using jumper wires.
