# 2x 8-bit Registers

This module contains two 8bit registers using the `74LS173` chip ([datasheet](https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Products/ProdDS/46922.pdf)).

The output is buffered behind an octal tri-state bus transceiver chip using the `74LS245` ([datasheet](https://www.futurlec.com/74LS/74LS245pr.shtml))
