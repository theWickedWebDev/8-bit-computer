# DIY 8-bit Computer

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

I made a modular  programmable 8bit computer inspired by [Ben Eater's design](https://github.com/beneater). I have made modifications to a few different modules including the ALU which offers many more functions including SHR and SHL, upgraded RAM to Static 128K x 8 CMOS with 16 addressable pins, 8 bit program counter, and a few other things.

Planning on increasing the instruction set, opcodes and overall amount of control this computer can handle.

(more info to come)

Included in this repository are all the libraries I have added to the default KiCad libraries, all of my schematics, PCB layouts, gerber files and screenshots.

This is a large project that has been going on for quite a while now and things are changing all the time. If you have any questions please reach out stephenyoung7267@gmail.com

# Modules

Each module directory contains schematics, PCB layouts, Kicad files, Gerber files, Fritzing files, images and descriptions to help anyone interested in this project.
